To implement
ignore users=> array of users 
{
    id
    name
}

check for user by name
calls to api, uses puppeteer to login, then, uh, search?
https://forums.somethingawful.com/query.php
<input name="q" type="text" id="query" value="">
so, document.getelementbyid('query');
username:"junk"

run search
gets page with this div, which contains a div that contains the uid
<div id="search_info">
Searched for posts which meet the following criteria:
<hr>
<div>Posted by user (name=Junk; uid=46145)</div>
<hr>
Showing results 1 to 10 of 1000 results. Query took 1.90 seconds to complete.
</div>

a nonexistent username returns this

<div class="search_message">
User darlingclementines was not found
</div>

so that should be pretty possible to write


*****
should invalidate token API side on logout

// Flow for e.g. album active status checkbox

// status is assigned in config.json
// control panel asks api for albums
// api reads config, sends to cpanel
// cpanel loads data into albums context
// component loads data, displays checkbox

// user clicks checkbox
// checkbox calls a value setting function
// value setting function
// 1. dispatches attempt action to albumscontext
// 1a. context changes value pending receipt of success or failure
// 2. calls setValue
// 	setValue calls API
// 	setValue returns true or false to value setting function
// 3. value setting function receives true or false
// 4. if true, value setting function dispatched success to context
// If true, we are done. maybe show a success message?

// 5. if false, value setting function dispatches failure to context
// 6. context reverts the value
// 7. Maybe show a failed toast?


return true if status === 200, else false
calling fn should deal with dispatching actions to context

parent component renders input
provides array of actions before, onSuccess, and onFailure
actions include prior value if necessary

user finishes input action
input action calls handleblur

handleBlur dispatches dispatchBefore =>
dispatch set action to context
context changes state to value

handleBlur calls api function
handleBlur hears from api success
if ncessary dispatches success action
context receives sucess
But context state already reflects new value

calling function hears from api failure
dispatches failure action
context receives failure
failure action
is set action to prior value


*****
use glob to collect actions
and generate control panel
and generate instructions
and collate post handler reducer
and collate pm handler reducer

Allow actions to use array of keys string[] for invoke
allow actions to use regex for invoke
