calling fn should deal with dispatching actions to context

parent component renders input
provides array of actions before, onSuccess, and onFailure
actions include prior value if necessary

user finishes input action
input action calls handleblur

handleBlur dispatches dispatchBefore =>
dispatch set action to context
context changes state to value

handleBlur calls api function
handleBlur hears from api success
if ncessary dispatches success action
context receives sucess
But context state already reflects new value

calling function hears from api failure
dispatches failure action
context receives failure
failure action
is set action to prior value
